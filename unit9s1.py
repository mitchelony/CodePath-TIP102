# You run a local bakery and are given the roots of two binary trees order1 
# and order2 where each node in the binary tree represents the number of a 
# certain cookie type the customer has ordered. To maximize efficiency, you 
# want to bake enough of each type of cookie for both orders together.

# Given order1 and order2, merge the order together into one tree and 
# return the root of the merged tree. To merge the orders, imagine that 
# when place one tree on top of the other, some nodes of the two trees are 
# overlapped while others are not. If two nodes overlap, then sum node 
# values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the not None 
# node will be used as the node of the new tree.

# Start the merging process from the root of both orders.

# Evaluate the time complexity of your function. Define your variables and 
# provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated 
# time complexity. Assume the input tree is balanced when calculating 
# time complexity.
